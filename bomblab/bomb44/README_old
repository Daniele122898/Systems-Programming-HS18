First, lets see if we can learn something by looking at the strings
encoded in the binary:

> strings simple_bomb

A lot of output, practice will tell you which to ignore, a couple of interesting
ones:
```
%*s %d
let's see
simple_bomb.c
well done
```

Maybe just try one of these as inputs?

> echo "let's see" | ./simple_bomb

Doesn't work. Lets look at the "%*s %d" string. Looks like a format string.
Assuming this string is used in scanf, this string, due to the *, will match
the first argument, but only stores the second argument. Hence, possibly, the
first string is ignored, but must still be present in the input. Let's try
something matching that format string

> echo "sdf 100" | ./simple_bomb

That already gives the additional output "let's see", but still fails.
Let's statically analyze the binary. Start with the symbol table

> objdump -t simple_bomb

From simple_bomb.c we know that "secret" is an the interesting function.

objdump -d simple_bomb | less

then let's go to <secret> by typing /secret<return>

First, a good idea is to see which functions are called (for instance with callq):
```__isoc99_sscanf@plt   --> this is the symbol for sscanf```
```puts``` 
```fail```
```fail```
In this order. Ignoring the option of jumps, it looks like the function is parsing
something using sscanf, probably using the format string we saw from strings "%*s %d".
Remember the signature of sscanf is sscanf(input, format, **args).
While we could now go on and understand the assembly in detail, it might
be easier to lunch the debugger and check at runtime the behavior.
Lets prepare a file input with our best guess of input so far so 
we can pass it as input to the gdb execution.

> gdb simple_bomb

gdb> b secret           (<-- in this case we have debugging information, but
                          if we have a pure binary, we could also break on addresses)
gdb> run "sdf 100"

... gdb hits the breakpoint ...
The usual commands like "l" (list source) are not avail since we don't
have the source. Hence switch to asm mode

gdb> layout asm

Now step through the function, we think we already have an understanding, it
will call sscanf and then do something with the return values...

gdb> ni
gdb> ni
gdb> ni

Now we should be just before the call to sscanf.
Remember the calling convention: RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9
lets, print the first argument

gdb> p $rdi

Decimal is ugly, hence print in hex

gdb> p/x $rdi

Now we get a memory address, but whats at this address? We can use 
the x command. And we want to interpret whats at this address as string,
hence we use x/s 

gdb> x/s $rdi

And, as expected it prints our input string, in the second argument to sscanf
we expect the format string

gdb> x/s $rsi

Yep! So the format string will make scanf store one argument, we expect
one pointers to be passed where the match is stored, the next args is RDX.

gdb> p/x $rdx

This gives the content of RDX, an address which will be overwritten. Step
after

gdb> ni

Now RDX should point to our 100. Use /u for the unsigned modifier.

gdb> x/u $rdx

Yep, it's 100. Lets have a look at the assembly how RDX actually got initialized:

0x5555555547e8 <secret+4>       lea    0xc(%rsp),%rdx

Hence it is stored on the stack. Lets see down from the actual code 
where this address is used the next time:

0x55555555480e <secret+42>      cmpl   $0x7e2,0xc(%rsp)

Our input is compared with the fixed value 0x7e2. Let's just try this
input:

gdb> quit

Now 0x7e2 is 2018 in decimal, hence let's try "sdf 2018" as input

> ./simple_bomb "sdf 2018"

Great, we found the secret value!
