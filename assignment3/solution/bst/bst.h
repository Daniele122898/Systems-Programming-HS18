// A "TreeNode" is the structure we use as a node in a BST.

typedef int (*TreeComparator)(void *element1, void *element2);

// Push a new element into the tree.
//
// Arguments:
//
// - root:    the root of the tree to insert into
// - element: the element to push into the tree 
// - f: the comparator function to use to compare nodes
// - newroot: an output parameter with the new root, if appropriate.
//
// Returns:
//
// - 1 if the element was added
// - 0 if we ran out of memory
// - -1 if the element was already in the tree, in which case
//   nothing is malloc'ed and the element is not re-added.
//   (The element already being in the tree implies the
//   comparator returned 0 for some element.)

// Arguments:

// - root: the root of the tree
// - findme: the element to find
// - f: the comparator function to use to compare nodes
// - element: an output parameter through which the found
//   payload is returned

// - 1 if a matching element was found
// - 0 otherwise
